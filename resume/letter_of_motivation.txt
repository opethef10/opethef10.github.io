To Whom It May Concern,
I am writing to express my strong interest in applying for a full-time position at your company. I reside in Gdynia, Poland, hold a valid work permit, and already have professional experience within the country, having previously completed an internship here. With 2 years of experience in Software Development and IT, primarily using Python and C#, I am eager to contribute my skills to your team.

My connection to Poland is personal and long-standing. Before taking the step to settle permanently and work here, I have been coming to Poland every summer for seven years, living with my girlfriend, spending time with her family and my Polish friends, and immersing myself in the culture and language, which I have come to love. I am constantly improving my Polish, which is currently at a B1 level, with the ultimate goal of achieving full fluency.

I graduated from Middle East Technical University (METU), the top-ranking institution in Turkey, where I pursued my studies in English and obtained the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering.

Since May 2024 till September 2024, I had been working as a Software Developer in Ankara, Turkey, single-handedly developing software for Spatial Load Forecasting (SLF) using C# and WinForms. My work included implementing verification algorithms, creating data imputation strategies, and analyzing benchmark data in Python to produce key performance indicator (KPI) reports.

Prior to that, in 2023, I worked for 9 months as a backend developer for a company specializing in public transportation optimization. There, I contributed to mobility tracking algorithms and gained hands-on experience with Python libraries such as GeoJSON, Pandas, FastAPI and using PostgreSQL database with other backend technologies.

Earlier in my career, for 10 months, I worked as a Python instructor, teaching students programming fundamentals and guiding them to develop 2D games. I also completed internships in Poland and Turkey, for the total of 6 months, where I worked on unit testing for Python and Django and end-to-end testing using JavaScript frameworks, respectively.

Beyond my professional roles, I have undertaken projects that demonstrate my skills and interests. I created a Formula 1 Fantasy League platform using Python's Django framework, which is played by approximately 100 players managing their teams and managing their budgets throughout the season. Additionally, I developed an online multiplayer web application for the board game Splendor using Django Channels, integrating artificial intelligence algorithms to enhance gameplay in a partially observed environment with asynchronous communication.

I am particularly skilled in Python, Django, FastAPI, and related frameworks, as well as JavaScript, Java, and C, C++, C#.  My focus is on creating robust, scalable solutions and leveraging advanced programming techniques to solve complex problems efficiently. I have experience managing projects independently and as part of a team, both remotely and on-site.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and passion for software development to your organization. I am confident that my experience and enthusiasm align with your company’s goals, and I am eager to contribute to your team’s success.

to the continued success of your organization.

Best regards,
Onur Arıkan
