To Whom It May Concern,

I would like to apply for a full-time work position in your company. I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering from Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara, Turkey.

I am particularly interested in working with Python, Django, FastAPI, Numpy, Pandas, or in Java, JavaScript, SQL, and C/C++, and I am eager to continue developing new programming skills.

Since May 2024, I have been working full-time as a Software Developer in Ankara, Turkey, where I develop software for Spatial Load Forecasting (SLF) using C# and WinForms. My role involves implementing verification algorithms, designing imputation strategies for handling missing data, and developing software in Python to analyze yearly benchmark data of pioneer electricity distribution companies and generate key performance indicator (KPI) reports.

In 2023, I worked on-site in Ankara, Turkey, as a backend developer in a company that creates public transportation optimizations. During my time there, I wrote algorithms that track the mobility of public transportation vehicles and analyze their origin and destination frequency. Additionally, I gained experience in FastAPI by working with their backend systems.

That same year, I also held a remote job as a Python Instructor, where I taught students the fundamentals of programming. By the end of the course, each student was able to develop and present a 2D game using Pygame.

During my 3-month-long summer internship in 2022 in Elbląg, Poland, I worked with Python and wrote unit tests for Django using test-driven development. This experience allowed me to work effectively with an international team.

In 2021, I completed a summer internship in Ankara, Turkey, where I worked with JavaScript, Node.js, Gherkin, and Cucumber.js, writing end-to-end tests for an Export Compliance Screening System.

I have extensive knowledge of the Python programming language, along with a solid foundation in data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented paradigms. Additionally, I have intermediate knowledge of C/C++. I am passionate about problem-solving and committed to delivering solutions that are both stable and satisfying.

Outside of my professional experience, I organize a Formula 1 Fantasy league that spans the whole Formula 1 season. The players can sign up and purchase drivers with their initial budget. During the course of the season, players manage their budget and trade drivers in each race in order to win. The league is attended by approximately 100 players and developed in Django. I also regularly analyze historical motorsports data through the Pandas library and draw meaningful conclusions. I have integrated this historical motorsports data into the database I use in my Django website.

For my senior project in my university, I developed an online multiplayer web application for the popular board game Splendor. We integrated an intelligent design system in a partially observed environment, using AI algorithms. The web application allows asynchronous communication between players in real time, providing a robust authentication system.

Furthermore, I develop games through the PyGame library in order to apply my knowledge about object-oriented paradigms, which helps me in skills such as managing and optimizing the growing scale of projects.

I am deeply interested in relocating to Poland, where my girlfriend lives. I have lived in Gdynia for two summers, have beginner-level proficiency in Polish, and already hold a work permit. My previous internship experience in Poland has solidified my desire to work there full-time.

Given this background, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your team and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how I can be an asset to your company. For further information, I have attached my CV and included a link to my projects and repositories on GitHub (https://github.com/opethef10).

Best regards,
Onur Arıkan
