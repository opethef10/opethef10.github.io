*TL;DR: Connect to one of these websites: [HTTP Forever](http://httpforever.com/) or [Never SSL](http://neverssl.com/)*

When you connect to a website that requires a login or demands secure interaction, such as logging into your bank account, you use the HTTPS protocol. Think of HTTPS like a security guard for your online activities. When you see `https://` in a web address, it signifies that your data is encrypted, creating a private conversation between you and the website. This encryption acts as a secret code, safeguarding your passwords and credit card information.

While HTTPS holds the advantage in terms of security, it isn't the default protocol of the internet. Ultimately, HTTPS is built upon HTTP. HTTP lacks an encryption system, making it inherently faster than HTTPS.

Now, imagine you're at a busy coffee shop, trying to connect to their Wi-Fi. This is where HTTP comes into play. Public Wi-Fi networks that require login can be a bit difficult to connect when you aren't redirected to a login page. It's because public Wi-Fi networks use unencrypted HTTP data to inject their login page data and redirect you to their login page. In this case, the public Wi-Fi networks work similarly to attackers. The only difference is that they use it to make you login to their network. And suppose you tried to get into your Facebook account right away after connecting to a public Wi-Fi network. This data will be encrypted by HTTPS. Just like your data is not visible to the attackers, public Wi-Fi also can't see your data, therefore they cannot inject their login form to your browser.

Nowadays most websites use HTTPS connections and that's the right and secure way to use internet. However, using safe HTTP-only websites can help you find the login pages of the public Wi-Fi networks. Some websites that are designed for this purpose, like [HTTP Forever](http://httpforever.com/) or [Never SSL](http://neverssl.com/), always use HTTP connections. This ensures easy access to sign-in pages in public networks.

However, after logging into the network, don't forget to use websites that use HTTPS especially when you are using your passwords or bank credentials, in case of an attacker that could target in the public Wi-Fi network. HTTPS connection encrypts your data in your browser and it stays encrypted until it reaches to the server and stays robust against man-in-the-middle attacks.
